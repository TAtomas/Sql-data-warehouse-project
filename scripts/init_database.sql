/*
=============================================================
Database and Schema Initialization Script
=============================================================
Description:
    This script creates a new database named 'DataWarehouse'. 
    It first checks if the database already exists; if found, it drops 
    the existing database and recreates it from scratch. 

    Once the database is created, the script defines three schemas: 
    'bronze', 'silver', and 'gold' â€” representing different data 
    processing layers.

Note:
    Executing this script will completely remove the existing 
    'DataWarehouse' database, including all its data and objects. 
    Ensure that backups are taken before running this script, 
    as data loss will be irreversible.
